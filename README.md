# Projects

Examples of various projects I have built as part of the BSc- Statistics and Data Science.

The projects are an example of the use of a variety of statistical tools such as Classification and Regression Models, Clustering,  machine learning, Simulations 
and their implementation by different programming languages.

The projects deal with the construction of statistical models for Prediction, Data Analysis and Conclusions.
