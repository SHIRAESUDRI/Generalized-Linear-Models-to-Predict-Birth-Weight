# Final Paper Generalized Linear Models Course- README
Analyze data and fit Logistic Regression Model to predict probability of newborn low birthweight, using R, Preliminary Analysis, Hypothesis Testing and Residual Diagnosis.

The project includes:
  - Preliminary analysis of the data:
  
    o Examining interesting relationships and Correlations between the explanatory variables.
    
    o Analysis different types of variables and Examining different distributions and trends of the continuous variables.

    o Examining Suspicious observations.
    
    o Examination of residues.   
   
  - Adaptation of an initial Logistic Regression model.
  - Hypothesis Testing.
  - Improving the model by using various statistical methods such as removing variables that do not add important information, residues analysis and removing abnormal observations, and adding linear combinations of the explanatory variables.
  - Select an improved Logistic regression model which will best predict the probability of newborn low birthweight.
